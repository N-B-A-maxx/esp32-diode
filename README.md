# Diode Signal Detector on ESP32

This project simulates a simple diode signal detector using the ESP32 microcontroller.

### How it works:
- A diode is used to allow or block signal flow based on its bias.
- Pin 25 of the ESP32 reads the signal after the diode.
- The Serial Monitor prints the voltage status.

### Objective:
To test the behavior of a diode when placed in forward or reverse bias using digital logic on an ESP32.
